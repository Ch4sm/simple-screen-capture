This is my first public project. Thanks to anyone who donates or subscribes to my YouTube Channel! I appreaciate it very much. 

The Screen Capture is a simple program that can capture your screen and save it to a JPG or PNG. I will update it as time goes by to add more features and remove glitches/bugs.
